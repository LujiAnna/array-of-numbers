# Project Development Strategy

## `Testing-Project-WEEK 1: Array-of-Numbers`

### Description

This is a collaborative HTML, CSS and JavaScript project. It consists of single dynamic webpage and 6 JS functions with the appropriate handlers. JavaScripts use a single global array variable.
It could be useful to boost team-developing skills, to practice JavaScript- Arrays 1 methods, HTML and CSS3 frameworks and to get used to develop scripts in a test-based environment.

> For this project we use an incremental development pattern, according to which each issue (UI or JS function) was developed in its own Git branch, reviewed and then added to the main project.

### 0. Set-Up

#### Assigned to: Anna

> On this step the project repo was generated from template.

Steps:

- Generate repo from template
- Turn on GitHub Pages
- Development-strategy file created

### 1. Creating UI

#### Assigned to: Anna

> On this step entire UI was set up. So the user can see a styled web page with a set of buttons each of which will be linked with JS function handler.

Steps:

- A new repo branch `html-css` was created.
- HTML markup was developed.
- CSS styling was added.
- The GitHub pull request was reviewed by reviewers and the branch was merged to the `master` branch.

### 2. Developing `Add` function and its handler.

#### Assigned to: Harun

> On this step user can run a function `add` by pressing on appropriate button.  
> This function add the user's number to the main shared array of numbers.

Steps:

- The new repo branch `add`was generated
- The core logic function was developed
- It was passed through a set of tests
- An appropriate handler was developed to use the function interactively.
- PR was raised, reviewed by two assigned reviewers and the branch
  was merged to the `master` branch.

### 3. Developing `Remove` function and its handler.

#### Assigned to: Yulia

> On this step user can run a function `remove` by pressing on appropriate button.  
> This function filters out all values that are strictly equal to toRemove.

Steps:

- The new repo branch `remove`was generated.
- The core logic function was developed
- It was passed through a set of tests
- An appropriate handler was developed to use the function interactively.
- PR was raised, reviewed by two assigned reviewers and the branch
  was merged to the `master` branch.

### 4. Developing `display` function and its handler.

#### Assigned to: Galal

> On this step user can run a function `display` by pressing on appropriate button.  
> This function converts an array of strings into an alert-friendly string.

Developing steps are similar to the previous:

- The new repo branch `display` was generated.
- The core logic function was developed.
- It was passed through a set of tests.
- An appropriate handler was developed to use the function interactively.
- PR was raised, reviewed by two assigned reviewers and the branch.
  was merged to the `master` branch.

### 5. Developing `greater` function and its handler.

#### Assigned to: Abdulhamid

> On this step user can run a function `greater` by pressing on appropriate button.  
> This function filters out all values that are not greater than lowValue.

Developing steps are similar to the the all project issues which concern JavaScript development:

- The new repo branch `greater` was generated.
- The core logic function was developed.
- It was passed through a set of tests.
- An appropriate handler was developed to use the function interactively.
- PR was raised, reviewed by two assigned reviewers and the branch.
  was merged to the `master` branch.

### 6. Developing `less` function and its handler.

#### Assigned to: Harun

> On this step user can run a function `less` by pressing on appropriate button.  
> This function filters out all values that are not less than highValue.

Developing steps are similar to the the all project issues which concern JavaScript development:

- The new repo branch `less` was generated.
- The core logic function was developed.
- It was passed through a set of tests.
- An appropriate handler was developed to use the function interactively.
- PR was raised, reviewed by two assigned reviewers and the branch.
  was merged to the `master` branch.  

### 7. Developing `average` function and its handler.

#### Assigned to: Yulia

> On this step user can run a function `average` by pressing on appropriate button.  
> This function computes the average of all numbers in an array of numbers.

Developing steps are similar to the the all project issues which concern JavaScript development:

- The new repo branch `average` was generated.
- The core logic function was developed.
- It was passed through a set of tests.
- An appropriate handler was developed to use the function interactively.
- PR was raised, reviewed by two assigned reviewers and the branch.
  was merged to the `master` branch.    

### 8. Writing "readme.md".

#### Assigned to: Galal

- README file was completed in the separate branch `readme` which was reviewed and merged to the `master`

### 9. Finishing Touches

#### Assigned to: Abdulhamid

On this step:

- W3C code validation made
- Bug and error fixes
